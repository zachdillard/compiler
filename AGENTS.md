# Repository Instructions

- This is a learning, non-production project.
- The project is a C#/.NET 11 RC1 implementation of the C compiler described in *Writing a C Compiler* by Nora Sandler. Keep compiler stages clear, testable, and easy to extend.
- The .NET 11 RC1 SDK and GCC on `PATH` are required. The custom compiler targets macOS x86-64; executing its output on Apple Silicon requires Rosetta 2.
- Keep changes simple, clear, and easy to understand.
- Keep commit messages simple unless additional detail is required.
- From the repository root, use `dotnet build` to build and `dotnet test` to run integration tests. Tests require GCC on `PATH`.
- From the repository root, run the book's chapter tests with `./tests/book_tests.sh --chapter <number>`. The script builds the compiler into `artifacts/book-tests/`, defaults to a sibling `writing-a-c-compiler-tests` checkout and forwards options to its `test_compiler` runner; use `BOOK_TESTS_DIR` when the test checkout is elsewhere. Python 3.8 or newer is required. Set `BUILD_CONFIGURATION` to select a build configuration; the default is Debug.
- The compiler accepts one C source path: `dotnet run --project src/Compiler.csproj -- <source-file>`. This selects the custom compiler implementation, which completes chapter one: a single `int` function with `void` parameters returning an integer constant.
- Use `dotnet run --project src/Compiler.csproj -- -gcc <source-file>` to select the temporary GCC-backed compiler. GCC preprocessing, assembly generation, and linking produce an executable beside the input; intermediate `.i` and `.s` files are removed after successful stages.
- Use `dotnet run --project src/Compiler.csproj -- -S <source-file>` for custom assembly-only mode, or combine `-S` and `-gcc` in either order (`dotnet run --project src/Compiler.csproj -- -gcc -S <source-file>`) for GCC assembly output without linking. The intermediate `.i` file is removed.
- The `concepts/` folder contains self-contained, file-based C# examples. From that folder, run an example individually with `dotnet <concept-name>.cs`.
- When adding a new C source file under `data/`, add its generated output file to `.gitignore`.
